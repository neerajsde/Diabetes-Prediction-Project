## Introduction

The project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. It involves data analysis, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of various machine learning models.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in the project contains information about individuals, including features like age, gender, smoking history, and diabetes status. The initial steps involve loading the dataset, checking dimensions, and examining basic statistics.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, converting data types, and standardizing numerical features. Descriptive statistics are used to understand the distribution of variables, and outliers are addressed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to visualize the distribution of variables, detect patterns, and understand relationships between features. Visualizations such as pie charts, bar plots, and histograms are used to gain insights.

## Machine Learning Models

Three machine learning models are implemented:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. K Neighbors Classifier

The models are trained on the dataset, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated, and the results are presented in terms of accuracy, mean squared error, and R2 score. Decision Tree Classifier achieved the highest accuracy among the models.

## Conclusion

The project concludes with a summary of the findings, highlighting the effectiveness of the Decision Tree Classifier in predicting diabetes. Further improvements and areas for exploration are discussed.
